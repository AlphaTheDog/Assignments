In your Python Repl, write a Python script that prompts the user for two integers using the input() function and attempts to divide the first integer by the second.
Use a try-except block to handle a potential ZeroDivisionError and print an error message if the user attempts to divide by zero.
Use a finally block to print a message indicating that the script has finished executing.
